In this project we try to facilitate the study of distribution of power across and within various Indian power institutions by analysing their inter-linkages, family trees, timelines, transactions, etc. to make more sense of the big political and corporate handshakes. In that direction, we envision to construct a system to collect data in this regard from various sources and integrate all of it into a single data store for others to use.

Our aim is to disseminate these findings to the mass society using a crowdsourced system, and use mass language for such a flow of information. and in this way, enhance governmental accountability and transparency using the notion of Open data and crowdsourcing.
