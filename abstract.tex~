In this project we try to find to study distribution of power across and within various Indian power institutions by analysing their inter-linkages, family trees, timelines, transactions, etc. to make more sense of the big political and corporate handshakes. Moreover, we envision to collect data in this regard from various sources and integrate all of it into a single data store for others to use.

We want to disseminate these findings to the mass society using a crowdsourced system, and use mass language for such a flow of information. and in this way, enhance governmental accountability and transparency using the notion of Open data and crowdsourcing.
