\chapter{Detailed System Design}

[TODO: fill]

here we describe our system in detail. sole aim reduce manual er work...though in the long run we will be 
crowdsourcing--but we want the design and research that goes behind the ER results ---  
to make verifiers task easy- aid with them in moderation process ---  design system, design views for ease of verifiers --  they should be focussed on investigating the links --- show them bext possible results \\

another key point which we have kept in mind always - 
it to make the data gatherers task easy without any hassle
 -- they should universally be able to communicate with the system, and should be able to keep track of their data, and also update their data as well, the data should be well seperarted in crawl data store - \\


a small note about web and other technologies used: framwork flask - adaptable - minimar web framwework, jimga tamplates, wtforms, py2neo, bootstrap used
talk abput two dbs - seperation of concerns -  explained in data integration section. 
crawl data store:
core data store:
all atcors revolve around these, we have role based system
actor with higher role can do all tasks that a lower one ca do and more \\


data gatherers --
use case diagram
  -- they should universally be able to communicate with the system, and should be able to keep track of their data, and also update their data as well, the data should be well seperarted in crawl data store - taskid, userid, tokens -- authentication, api description
  there we talked about json, hwre we talk about api, and metada saved with it
  --va;idations in api in tendem with the data model described  \\
-api snapshot
of what is the view
what is the resulkt from prstman

verifiers/moderators 
use cas edigarm
-- valid url checked again --
to reolve mean: give a uuid and a relid 

selection algo
and then search -- search query explained in diff section
explain match view, explain diff view
colors in diff view
session checks - resume task
ribust validation chekcing --- no data should get go to worng core data object
locks parallization = apscheduler lib python
views, jaro, search query, view plavcement, diff
jaro useful in some cases only
phonetic serves the purpose, more algos can be fit in
diff new labels, new props, type, conf props, -- name, aliases, lists - mvps!! 
lists and mvps handling imp \\


a mini-guide to manual verification -- reema sarkar -- [an image]
very imp as only write happens through verifier
shortest path
expand on nodes in neo4j yuvraj singh a falase case can describe
examples of connection --- between sons etc. 
screenshots verifier \\
 

registered users
wiki
use case diagram
explain the design all goes into crawldb
all is verfied- always 
screenshots
read api
wiki \\


provanance
screenshots can be seen by users
how is it done
when verifier verifies
explain
all inputs that we track
see the fn \\

admin:
delete index
refresh index
eleveate users
verfier contributions
bots


end users:
read profiles
see connections
cypher read query - explain - etc.
limit automatically
viz
provenance view
sign up\\

database model er diagrm sanphot meta db - index table also include?? [left] \\
