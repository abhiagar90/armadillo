\section{Conclusion}
What can you conclude from your work?? What are your conclusions from the data collection stage? How and why is it difficult to get Indian data?? Did the data model worked well with graph db ?? Is it possible to resolve entities from two different datasets and find interesting connections??  What did your system show after data mashup?? How practical is your system taskflow if deployed in real world?? In short what hypothesis you predicted before starting to build the system?? Do you find them in the results?? Any other interesting patterns?? 

\section{Future work}
%\lipsum[2]
We have tried to start a process of building a system which in the long run will help the Indian society. Our best efforts were to cover up as much functionality as possible. Yet however, many other problems or features are left to be done in future.
%TODO - expand the questions
\begin{itemize}
\item Scaling up - How the system would scale up? How to handle more data when it is fed to the system?
\item Better Visualizations - Can the visualizations be saved/ annotated/ more interacting??
\item Inference Engine - Can the inferencing process be automated? Like in expert systems which uses a knowledge base and Prolog scripts to produce more knowledge??
\item Better analysis of Social Networks - can the different questions about the social graph be answered? What about degree centrality?? No. of weak ties?? Clusters and their strengths? Can we compare with the random graph model to produce some interesting social network behaviors ??
\item Better Query Engine - Can the query engine be improved so that even users not knowing CQL can give queries?
\item Other use cases - Can other data be looked to expand the network with more nodes and relations?? What about IAS officers?? Monetary donations?? Media ownerships??
\end{itemize}
