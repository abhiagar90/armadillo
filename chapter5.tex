\section{Future Work}
The constant aim would be to push as much data as possible and stablize the system as soon as possible. The query engine is very basic as of now. The further plan is to give users a platform to give structured queries to the system. We also plan to extend our sources of data, use information extraction algorithms to extract relationships from blogs, newspaper articles where the data is totally unstructured. The UI/accessibility of the system needs to be improved so that the verifiers, moderators, end-users can access the related pages/info readliy. 

\section{Conclusion}
%\lipsum[2]

The system should be able to answer such questions as we move along:
\begin{itemize}
\item Preference between corporate donations to political parties.
\item Preference between donation source locations and political parties.
\item Ex-bureaucrats in corporate jobs and their political ties.
\item Identification of shell companies/fraud companies in donation transactions and investments.
\item Family trees of political candidates, corporate giants.
\end{itemize}

We are still at a very nascent stage. Trying to learn in our work and hopeful to create something beneficial for the society in future.
