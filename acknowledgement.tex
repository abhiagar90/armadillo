We thank him for setting high standards, giving us freedom to explore multiple facets of the problem and teaching us the value of analytical thinking and hard work. We are also grateful to Manoj Kumar, Anirban Sen and Dipanjan Chakraborty who have helped a great deal by providing their support during difficult times and whose suggestions went a long way in making this work a reality.
