I would like to express my heartiest gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Aaditeshwar Seth for guiding this work with utmost interest and scientific rigor. I thank him for setting high standards, giving me freedom to explore multiple facets of the problem and teaching me the value of analytical thinking and hard work. I am also grateful to Manoj Kumar, Anirban Sen and Dipanjan Chakraborty who have helped a great deal by providing their support during difficult times and whose suggestions went a long way in making this work a reality. I am highly indebted to Preeti Rani, Mridul Goel and Md. Imran for actually sitting with me and working on perfecting the final system. I would also like to thank my family and friends for their love and support and bearing with me for my constant absence.\\
